# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 repository! This is where I will be documenting my solutions for the Advent of Code challenges.

## About

I am attempting to solve all the challenges in C, but some parts might be implemented in other programming languages like Python for ease of use. Please note that not all parts for each day may be implemented unless they are in the same file.

## Running the Solutions

To run the solutions, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kam-stand/ADVENT_OF_CODE_2024.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory of the specific day:

   ```bash
   cd DAY_*
   ```

3. Run the solution:
   ```bash
   bash run.sh
   ```

## Disclaimer

I did not use best practices when implementing my solutions. Many of them are brute force. I am doing this for practice and learning purposes.

Happy coding!
